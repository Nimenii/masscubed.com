## Quote Awards!

**Most desperate quoters:**

Oh boy, this one is definitely earned by all those who have scraped a spot on the board. So this month's most desperate quotes go to Sean and Tanner. Please clap..

*"I've never had a quote..."* - Tanner

*"I don't have a quote on there"* - Sean

**"You're going to hell" Award:**

As the title may suggest, this person has a certain type of personality to deliver quotes that have a large chance of banishing the quoter to the lowest depth of the lowest realm of hell. This month the winner is obvious. Sorry Hayden, it's one way trip to become Satan's mistress for you.

*"I like my animals like I like my violence. Domestic."* - Hayden

*"Dark matter - True; Dark People's rights - False"* - Hayden

**Most wholesome quote:**

This award is a rarity, probably for obvious reasons. It celebrates the quote that manage to make it on the board not for their shock value, but for their ability to improve our lives. Unfortunately, the winner's name this week is unknown. Sad reacts only please.

*"Disco Disco Good Good"* - Our Lord/Savior/Daddy
