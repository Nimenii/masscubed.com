May 2017 will hopefully be of a special significance to MASS^3 as this month was host to the Monash Advanced Science Student Showcase, or MASS^2 for short. This was a chance for the brilliant minds and personalities in the Advanced Science courses to show off and present their various research projects, business pitches, and other speeches of various style.  The night was run through the joint effort of the wonderful MCs Peter Halat and Loren Pugh, who made sure MASS^2 was an entertaining and well run event. 

MASS^2 of course, would not have been as successful as it was (or in fact, it wouldn't have existed) without the talented speakers who dedicated their time and expertise to provide the content for the conference. They are, in order of appearance: Michael Beards, Bernard Field, Fergus McLaren, Anthony Salib, Madeline Gordon, James Salamy, Luke Giles, Ethan (Ashton) Payne and Martin Nguyen. I know that I am extremely grateful for the effort that each one of these speakers put into their presentations, and I am confident that this sentiment is shared by all members of the MASS^3 committee.

A major source of personal enjoyment from the night
