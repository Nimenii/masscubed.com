May 2017 will hopefully be of a special significance to MASS^3 as this month was host to the Monash Advanced Science Student Showcase, or MASS^2 for short. This was a chance for the brilliant minds and personalities in the Advanced Science courses to show off and present their various research projects, business pitches, and other speeches of various styles.  The night was run through the joint effort of the wonderful MCs Peter Halat and Loren Pugh, who made sure MASS^2 was an entertaining and well run event.

MASS^2 of course, would not have been as successful as it was (or in fact, it wouldn't have existed) without the talented speakers who dedicated their time and expertise to provide the content for the conference. They are, in order of appearance: Michael Beards, Bernard Field, Fergus McLaren, Anthony Salib, Madeline Gordon, James Salamy, Luke Giles, Ethan (Ashton) Payne and Martin Nguyen. I know that I am extremely grateful for the effort that each one of these speakers put into their presentations, and I am confident that this sentiment is shared by all members of the MASS^3 committee.

A major source of personal enjoyment during the night was Peter's well crafted puns which he consistently fired off when inviting each speaker to begin their presentation. I will not do the puns dishonor of repeating them out of context in this article. However, I will remark that each and every one of  them was a piece of well-crafted wordplay that added a layer of humor to the incredibly long and technical titles of many of the presentations. If I could put finger-guns into writing Peter, I would.

On the research oriented presentations, a great range of topics were explored within the schools of chemistry, physics, mathematics and geology. However, other than a short snippet in Michael(/Keith/Pablo/Boris)'s speech, the biological sciences were mostly absent from the night. This should be taken as a sign to those members of MASS^3 whose interest lies in the biological fields to assert their significance by embracing the next MASS^2 conference. 

Onto a different style of speech was a motivational piece urging us as scientists to "Dream the impossible" by Fergus McLaren, a Global Challenges student. Within his speech he demonstrated the ability to switch focus from broad concepts to specific examples with a flow that captured our attention as the audience. Fergus's presentation even managed to spawn a discussion in the audience about whether or not the society in Star Trek is a utopia, which only aided in the entertainment aspect of the night. It was however unfortunate at the lack of representation of the GC cohort within the MASS^2 conference, however it is my hope that the next conference will see a higher turnout.

During the halftime intermission (before making my way to the gourmet catering provided for the event) I had a chance to talk with Peter, who in a hushed but elated voice told me of his excitement at the great turnout of MASS^3 members as well as prominent Monash staff members such as Prof. Michael Morgan (Head of School for the School of Physics and Astronomy) and Dr Christopher Thompson (Associate Dean of Education). These prominent staff members have greatly increased the formality and the prestige of the event, as well as added their own insight and curiosity with their questions after the conclusions of speeches.   

A common aspect of many of the presentations given on this night was the potential for future followups spawned from the speakers' projects. Whether it be the derivation promised by Anthony Salib, or the further development and calculations within Ethan Payne's (the JAFFY researcher) project, I know that I am interested to see what these future developments will lead to.

The night was ended with a few awards given out to two exemplary speakers. As voted by the audience, Fergus McLaren won the title of "Most Entertaining Presentation" and Martin Nguyen won "Most Informative Presentation". Congratulations to these two speakers, they deserved it.

As the night came to a close, I managed to get a few short words from Lincoln Turner, without who this conference wouldn't have been possible. He described MASS^2 as a "Fantastic Student run and student organised conference" that by virtue of being "student motivated" rather than "university run" managed to capture the talents, passion and brilliance of the presenters.

I would like to give a final word of thanks to the MCs, speakers and the members of the MASS^3 committee as well as Lincoln, who helped make the conference as informative and entertaining as it was.
