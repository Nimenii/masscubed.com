The time has finally come, dear  members of MASS^3. The time has come for there to be a comprehensive review of the hype level of the numerous coffee shops dotted around campus. Fortunately, I have been rigorously testing (along side my noble co-reviewer Liam Azara) the various cafes on campus. It has been an eye-opening semester thus far, very caffeinated and full of both great and terrible coffee, but we have come out of it victorious.

# Coffee-Hype Index (CHI)

Alongside testing the coffee I have worked to develop this measure of coffee hype. I will now take you through how I got there.

Let us first introduce the variable for CHI:

To start off with the basics, most scales use some sort of rating out of ten, so we will do the same. So now CHI is equal to the sum of my rating and Liam's rating:

However, this is not enough. The hype felt when drinking a cup of coffee is inversely proportional to the amount of hard earned cash one had to drop in order to acquire it, so adding a variable for the price we get:

Now comes the time variables. The coffee shops around campus are fairly spread out, so the time it takes to get to them must be taken into account as the longer it takes to get to the cafe, the more annoyance is spawned to counteract the hype, so we must subtract a variable to take this into account. Now as there are no coffee shops right next to the common room (unfortunately) we wont use the absolute time, but the standard deviation of the time it takes to get to the cafes from the mean time. Thus we get:

On the topic of time, the coffee, to my great sadness, does not arrive instantly when I order it. So the time between ordering and receiving the coffee is treated in the same way as time taken to get to the cafe:

Finally, the last thing that must be considered is personal preference. More accurately how much someone cares about the price, or the time. Therefore, let's add two more variables that are unique to each person that describe how much their personal hype is affected:

And there we have it. The formula used to quantify the hype of the coffee offered around campus!

# Methodology

Starting in the common room, we set our destination to a certain coffee store and used a phone timer to  measure the time taken to get there. Once there, a small coffee would be ordered each and a timer would be started to measure the time to coffee. I ordered a cappuccino and Liam ordered a mocha to account for both the complexity of preparing these drinks, and their popularity.

The price of a 16oz (473ml) cup of coffee would be recorded, as this is the standard size that all cafes carry although it may be called different names (Regular at Grafali's, Large at Secret Garden).

While we wait for our coffee we would make notes on the A E S T H E T I C C of the coffee store and the general environment/perks (Lactose free milk, other drinks, etc.).

Once the coffee is received, we do a very intricate taste test that is reminiscent of sommeliers. We judge the taste, creamy nature, sweetness, burn aspect, bitterness, texture and the most hipster-esq quality, mouthfeel. Using these aspects we both give it a score out of ten.

All of this is, obviously, recorded in the most secure and professional way possible; on the back of the receipt.

# Results

Let's do this in ascending order of CHI, just to make sure you are left with a pleasent taste in your mouth.

### Grain Express:

**Scores:**

* Shon: 2/10

* Liam: 3/10

* CHI: 1.11

So, first off, many of you may be surprised that this place sells coffee at all. I mean, the staff there were surprised when we asked for coffee, despite having coffee prices clearly advertised. Liam and I also got the impression that we were quite possibly the only customers they have had that asked for coffee in the past year at least. But I guess we got what we ordered... barely.

After the confusion abated, and the coffee machine dusted, our coffees were finally made. Let me just say that I am thankful this was the last place we tested, as I am pretty sure my tongue was left with at least second degree burns after drinking it. The coffee was well burnt, and barely tasted like coffee in fact. I would describe it like bitter, watery milk. We did not finish this cup of coffee.

The  price of this coffee doesn't even redeem it, as the standard size costs $4 there. Do yourself a favour, don't make the same mistake Liam and I did.

### St. Ali's Church of Secular Coffee

**Scores:**

* Shon: 3/10

* Liam: 2/10

* CHI: 1.15

Despite the fancy name and the cozy hipstery interior, this cafe ranks as one of the worst. While it does seem like a nice place to sit down and talk about the day, all the while looking at the hordes of other stressful students milling about ourside, it may be a bit to expensive to be able to afford this luxury. In fact, this is the most expensive coffee shop on campus. For a massive $5 for the standard sized coffee, no amount of hipster blends or fancy deconstructed interior can make me not cry for the poor souls that frequent the establishement.

The actual coffee is also quite disappointing to say the least. While i could stomach the burnt brew, Liam took two steps out of the cafe, and proceeded to pour the remainder of his cup down the nearest sewer drain. At least this coffee did not physically assult me I guess.

### Coffee Point

**Scores:**

* Shon: 3/10

* Liam: 2/10

* CHI: 1.85

We finally reach what is classically the worst coffee on campus. And while the coffee here is quite bad, it does seem to be better than these other two places. Maybe it is because of its central location that it gets a worse rap than Grain Express and Church. However, this is not to say that there are any redeeming qualities to the coffee here. This was the only place that made Liam say that he would rather "Lick a toilet seat" than drink another drop of that coffee. In fact, I described it as "tasting how a back alley smells" so  unfortunatly for coffee point, it does not earn any redemption in this study. It does however earn the title of cheapest coffee on campus... by a whole 5 cents. Do yourself a favour and visit one of the later coffee shops on the list, even if they may be 5 cents more expensive.
