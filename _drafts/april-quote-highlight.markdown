Spoken like someone who truely has got their life figured out. Nice one.

**A quick note:** 

Unfortunatly as it turns out I wont be writing a piece covering the trivia night that happened a few weeks back. I lacked the foresight to bring something to take down notes for an article which was a bad move as I don't have the finer details of what happened on the night. However, I would like to take a moment to thank all those who helped plan and run the night, it was great fun.

On that note, if anyone in the future wants to contribute to the newsletter, be it covering an event or if you just have an idea for an article contact me or send me the piece I'll work it into the next edition.
