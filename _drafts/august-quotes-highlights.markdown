After a busy few weeks and a "mid-semester" break we are back at it. With all the madness of this entire time, a plethora of semi-insane or just institutionally troubled quotes have made it up to the shrine that is the whiteboard.

However, before we proceed with the quotes, one more thing is needed. Let's talk about the AGM. The AGM this year was again, a complete success (especially as sufficient pizza was supplied this time). The amount of people going for positions was surprisingly high this year, which is always a good sign. More importantly, we now Have an entirely new committee.

Headed by our new president, Chris Bounds, this new committee aims to challenge and improve upon the glorious success of the previous committee that was run by out former supreme hype-overlord Peter Halat. Second in command to Boundsy is our new vice president Lachlan King, who will ensure Chris stays on the straight and narrow.

Our new secretary is Maddy Howell, who did not know what she was getting into when applying for this position, but is sure to conquer it.

Returning as treasurer is Bernard Field, the absolute financial wonder who has graced us with his near-divine work over the past year, and graciously will do so over the next one.

Lauren Kirn Enters the Committee as our new Event's coordinator promising us a year filled with perfectly run events and baked goods (better fulfill your election promise there). In a surprising turn of events, past president and event coordinator, as well as overall g, Michael/Keith/Pablo/Boris has been voted in as an adjunct assistant events coordinator who has grand plans as to improve the quality, and increase the quantity of events.

Yours truly was re-elected as editor, and I plan to abuse this power in many more totally unbiased studies on the campus in hopes to entertain you all.

Our new education officer is Ethan Payne, with his mad connections to the school of physics, and promises to create connections to the other school. I for one, have high hopes for this one (as foolish as this may be). Make sure you like @nopaynenogain on Facebook!

Finally, last but definitely not least, Hayden McMahon is our new webmaster. He hopes to improve on the great work of Hans Kek, and has already began on giving the website (Masscubed.net check it out) a much needed update.

With the AGM concluded, a fantastic meme sesh was had at a booked lecture theater. Speaking of memes, let's get on with the quotes!
