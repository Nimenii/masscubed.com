# A Quick Intro

So before we get into the borderline insanity that are the common room quotes, let me introduce myself. I am Shon Kolomoisky, your new editor. I know an update to the Monthly has been a long time coming, but better late than never right? Either way, I plan on future articles being more punctual than this one. If you are reading this article and want to contribute to the Monthly, feel free to speak to me or message me.

Now, onto the good part.

# Quote Awards!

## Most Quotable Personality:

Take this as you will. This award either represents someone who is thoroughly interesting, deep and witty, or someone with such a messed-up level of humour that the contents exiting their mouth is the verbal equivalent of whatever animals evolved to survive the Chernobyl exclusion zone. Either way we love them and all their numerous quotes.

This month’s winner, is the one, the only, Jack Polmear! Good job on your 6 quotes that made it onto the board.

## Most Desperate Quote-Attempt:

This one is self-explanatory, an award for those who would go through anything to get on the prestigious quote wall. This month’s winner is clear, gg Nobby with your marvellous quote:

*“I need to get a quote up there”* – Nobes

## The Quote that Made Me Want to End Myself the Most:

*“I have like 9 contact hours”* – Resident arts student (aka Rachel)

‘nuff said.
