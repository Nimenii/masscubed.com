## The AGM?

The *Annual General Meeting* happens every year in September, and it's your chance to elect the new committee for next year - maybe even go for a role yourself!

The roles up for grabs are:

-President (in charge of coordinating the club and making sure *shit* gets done)
-Vice-President (helps the president)
-Secretary (in charge of taking minutes each meeting, checking the club mailbox weekly. Also the only member with access to the membership list)
-Treasurer (manages the finances of the club, including doing the club audit each semester)
-Events Coordinator (organises all the social events of the club. In particular, runs Trivia and Karaoke night)
-Education Officer (liasions with the faculty - in particular, Rowan and Lincoln, the course coordinators)
-Webmaster (manges the website)
-Editor (writes this exact newsletter - usually has one or two updates a semester)

Note: if you cannot make it on the night and would like to vote for someone or nominate for a position, please message [Victoria Bicknell](https://www.facebook.com/victoria.bicknell1) before the event starts (that is 6:00 pm, 21st of Wednesday).
