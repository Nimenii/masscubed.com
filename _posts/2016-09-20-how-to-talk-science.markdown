Here's the problem: [science is still poorly communicated to the general public](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/14/12016710/science-challeges-research-funding-peer-review-process). As a result, journalists and media outlets publish sensationalised, often misleading claimsâ€” which in turn cause laypeople to hold on to completely unscientific ideas or have a crude view of how science works.

The solution? Better science communication! And how do you learn that? Through the _Vox Club_!

This Thursday the 6th of October, _Vox_ is holding [an interactive event](https://www.trybooking.com/Booking/BookingEventSummary.aspx?eid=228313), teaching the basics of science communication through effective storytelling, public speaking and memorization techniques. The goal of this workshop is so you can ace those honours presentations, explain your lab report to your grandma, and communicate confidently, anywhere, anytime.

It will be held at the Green Chemical Futures Foyer from 6:00pm to 8:30pm, and tickets are priced at $5 for one, or $12 for three (bring friends!). Note that the tickets include **dinner**! You can find out more at their [TryBooking web page](https://www.trybooking.com/Booking/BookingEventSummary.aspx?eid=228313).
