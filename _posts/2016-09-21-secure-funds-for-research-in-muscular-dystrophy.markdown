## About the Cause

Muscular Dystrophy (MD) is a life threatening genetic condition that causes the gradual wasting away of muscles. Eventually making daily tasks impossible without help. One in every 2900 males and 50 million females are born with, or develop, a form of MD.

The Australian Regenerative Medicine Institute (ARMI) is currently researching possible regenerative medicine treatments for MD. However, they are missing a vital piece of equipment that will help speed up research. They need our help to fund a qPCR machine to improve the speed and accuracy of their research to help find possible treatments for MD.

## How the Funding Works

Every dollar you donate is QUADRUPLED! Every single dollar YOU contribute to ARMI will be matched by a group of three extraordinary benefactors to help reach our goal!

Remember: The campaign is **ALL OR NOTHING** â€“ we must raise the full amount within 24 hours, or all donations will be returned.

Your support will allow ARMI to continue research to one day find a cure for MD!
